# Getting Help
Resources for getting help with mCerebrum and Cerebral Cortex are available in the following locations:

* [MD2K.org/software/softwareuserguides/](https://md2k.org/software/softwareuserguides/)
* [discuss.md2k.org](https://discuss.md2k.org/)

The discussion site is our preferred way to support the platforms, instead of email, as it allows for others to benefit from the discussions.
