### Visualize Real-Time Data
Using the Plotter app included with mCerebrum, you can select from a list of available sensors to visualize each set of data in real-time.

The software displays a real-time plot of whichever data you select. This allows you to easily see if data collection is working as you monitor heart rate, breathing patterns, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and more.

### Surveys & Interventions
EMA (ecological momentary assessment) surveys and intervention exercises can be delivered to and completed by users directly through the mCerebrum smartphone interface. Surveys can occur at random times or based on triggers such as stress or eating episodes that are detected through wearable sensors.
