## Visualize Real-Time Data
Using the Plotter app included with mCerebrum, you can select from a list of available sensors to visualize each set of data in real-time.

The software displays a real-time plot of whichever data you select. This allows you to easily see if data collection is working as you monitor heart rate, breathing patterns, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and more.
