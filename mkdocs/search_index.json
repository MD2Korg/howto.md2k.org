The mCerebrum platform is divided into functional layers so that each component is flexible and can be adapted and extended without adversely affecting the other components.  Two components \u2013 an access controller and data router \u2013 links each layer.  The access controller is responsible to ensuring that pairs of components within the system have appropriate credentials to communicate with each other through the data router, which is responsible for routing data objects throughout the platform.\n\n\nTo meet future needs, we anticipate continuing to adapt and augment the mCerebrum platform to support future technologies and the needs of new studies. The component-based architecture is easily modified and adapted to specific studies and the simple APIs should provide for easy integration into existing applications. mCerebrum has the following layers and associated application components:\n\n\nMobile Sensor Support for Data Collection\n\n\nmCerebrum provides support for reliable data collection from mobile and wearable sensors in excess of 800 hertz, and real-time processing of these data for sensor-triggered just-in-time adaptive interventions. mCerebrum currently supports a variety of data sources including:\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft band (accelerometers, gyroscopes, galvanic skin response, UV exposure)\n\n\nAutoSense Chest (ECG, respiration, galvanic skin response, accelerometer)\n\n\nAutoSense Wrist (accelerometer, gyroscope, galvanic skin response)\n\n\nEasySense (ultrawideband radio frequency for lung fluid and cardiorespiratory motion)\n\n\nOmron BLE Blood Pressure Monitor (blood pressure)\n\n\nOmron BLE Weight Scale (weight, balance, frailty)\n\n\nAndroid smartphones (GPS, accelerometers)\n\n\niCO Smokerlyzer (smoking status)\n\n\n\n\nThese sensor platforms communicate with mCerebrum over one of four interfaces: 802.15.4, Bluetooth, headphone port, or local API.\n\n\nmCerebrum supports real-time data processing algorithms to evaluate stress, activity, driving/riding, smoking, and conversation. mCerebrum collects user reported data collection through EMAs, intervention response, and self reports.\n\n\nFinally, mCerebrum provides end-to-end access control, encryption, and data source linage along with a simple set of APIs for application development that is freely available under the open source BSD 2-clause license.\n\n\nCommunication Interfaces\n\n\nData sources are either on the smartphone or come from external devices that can be connected to the platform through various radios or wire interfaces:\n\n\n\n\n802.15.4 (ANT+)\n\n\nBluetooth\n\n\nheadphone port\n\n\nlocal\n\n\n\n\nThe Microsoft Band, EasySense (lung fluid and heart/lung motion), and Omron (blood pressure and weight) devices have custom applications that utilize the Bluetooth radio to interact with the device and relay data into mCerebrum. \nMicrosoft Band\n samples accelerometer, gyroscope, GSR, light, and heart rate for measuring arm movements for eating and smoking behavior detection. \nAutoSense\n receives data from multiple devices over an 802.15.4 (ANT+) radio that includes: Chest, which contains ECG, respiration, and accelerometer data and Wrist, which samples accelerometer and gyroscope information before sending data into Data Kit.  A Bluetooth version of AutoSense is under development for more flexibility in deployments. These two radio chipsets represent most of the wireless communication between wearable sensors and a smartphone and are currently integrated into mCerebrum.\n\n\nThe ICO smokerlyzer is connected to mCerebrum via the headphone jack. Our platform is able to communicate over this connection with the device to measure carbon monoxide of a smoker in the field. The \nPhone Sensor\n application can record all available sensors on a smartphone platform and is typically configured to record the accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, CPU, and battery levels from the device. Once data has arrived on mCerebrum through any one of the interfaces, it is routed via the data router and Data Kit. We have applications that integrate into mCerebrum across a variety of different communication modalities and push data into our common data core, Data Kit, for use by additional signal processing.\n\n\nSignal processing\n\n\nA signal processing layer is responsible for converting sensor data into markers on which the Intervention Kit acts.  The primary real-time data processor, \nStream Processor\n, subscribes to data sources produced by the lower tiers and produces markers for the upper tiers.  Currently, it contains signal processing algorithms designed to compute various features and markers including: data quality of raw sensor signals:\n\n\n\n\npuffMarker\n uses respiration (from a chest band) and hand gesture data (from wrist sensors) to determine when each cigarette puff occurs\n\n\nactivity recovery\n uses interbeat interval (from ECG) and activity level (from accelerometers) to measure the body\u2019s recovery time after an exercise period as an index of cardiac fitness\n\n\ncStress\n uses ECG, respiration, and accelerometer data to an estimated the likelihood of stress for each minute that these sensors are worn properly\n\n\nstress trigger\n converts the stress probabilities into episodes of high and low stress that can be used to decide whether to trigger a stress intervention\n\n\ndriving detector\n that determine if a person is involved in driving a motorized vehicle\n\n\n\n\nThe stream processor performs this computation in one-minute blocks that provides near real-time markers for other applications. A visualization layer contains multiple components around displaying the results of the signal processing and can be shown to the participant as necessary but is typically utilized for gaining a sense of how well the system if functioning on the backend.\n\n\nStorage interfaces\n\n\nStorage interfaces provide encrypted data storage and transport capabilities and are subject to the privacy controller, which allows a participant to temporally disable sensor data flow within the system according to rules dictated by the study rules. There are currently three storage interfaces:\n\n\n\n\nData Kit\n is designed to manage and store information produced by all layers and is a key component of mCerebrum data pipeline. It provides an encrypted data store (SQLite) and exposes publisher/subscriber and query interfaces for other components.\n\n\nA \nCerebral Cortex\n interface to the system allows for data to be offloaded periodically, depending on quality of service constraints, from mCerebrum via an encrypted REST API over a secure cellular or Wi-Fi network to a Cerebral Cortex cloud service for additional storage and signal processing.\n\n\nA \ndata export\n interface is provided to allow for researchers to extract all recorded information from a mCerebrum device onto a computer for analysis.\n\n\n\n\nParticipant interaction\n\n\nParticipants interact with the system through a suite of applications.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nmCerebrum-Study\n application that provides user interfaces to additional applications and allows for the configuration of the system.\n\n\nThe \nEMA\n and \nSelf Report\n applications are designed to all for the delivery of scheduled or event-based questionnaires to the participant and to deliver any self-reported information.\n\n\nWe developed several applications designed around stress reduction techniques, \nMood Surfing\n and \nThought Shakeup\n, and also support the launching of any external intervention application.\n\n\nPlotter\n, a real-time data visualization tool, allows the participant to visualize many of the raw sensor signals to aid in attaching and verifying the quality of sampled data.\n\n\nIntervention kit\n is a sensor-triggered EMA and intervention application bridges this layer with the signal-processing layer to provide data-driven and scheduled notifications and interventions. It also provides an API for notifying a participant either through a wearable device or the smartphone via different modalities, which include vibration and sound. The ability to provide just-in-time interventions based on a real-time analysis of high-frequency data streams and its ability to combine diverse data streams from a variety of sensors is a key capability of mCerebrum.\n\n\n\n\nFor example, puffMarker uses multiple data streams (respiration, and wrist-based accelerometers and gyroscopes) to detect when a cigarette puff occurs.  This puff information is utilized by the intervention manager to provide alerts to the participant through mCerebrum's notification system that sends a set of configurable messages, tones, and vibrations to a Microsoft band and the smartphone. Failure to acknowledge the intervention or message can result in repeated attempts to contact followed by an escalation of causing additional alerts to be sent.\n\n\nSimilarly, ECG, respiration, and accelerometer data is used by the cStress model to assess the likelihood of stress that is then used to generate triggers for launching stress intervention apps.",

A Kernel links the layers to provide security controls between modules and a unified data interface to abstract implementation specifics. To meet future needs, we anticipate continuing to adapt and augment the Cerebral Cortex platform to support future technologies and the needs of new studies. Cerebral Cortex has the following layers and associated modules:\n\n\nGateway\n\n\nA gateway layer operates in front of all the other layers to provide secure interfaces and APIs for interfacing with the platform.  This currently includes maintaining HTTP over SSL and routing requests to the appropriate internal platforms.\n\n\nUser interfaces\n\n\nThe user interface layer is currently composed of four core applications:\n\n\n\n\nA \nstudy administration web portal\n which provides a secure and encrypted interface that allows study coordinators to conduct, configure, and monitor field studies with mCerebrum.\n\n\nPersonal Activity and Location Measurement System\n (PALMS) that is designed to process GPS information and produce features based on physical activity and location. It also provides a set of APIs on which other applications can utilizes its functionality.\n\n\nA \nhealth science visualization\n through our Discovery Dashboard provides data visualizations designed for the health community, which aid in data interpretation by transforming the high-frequency sensor data streams into key digital biomarkers.\n\n\nA \ndata science visualization\n complements Discovery Dashboard by providing a mechanism for inspecting multiple high-frequency data streams.\n\n\n\n\nMachine interfaces\n\n\nA set of machine interfaces complements the UI by providing several different APIs for both Cerebral Cortex\u2019s internal applications and as an interface to external web services and other data sources.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nCerebral Cortex API\n is designed to work in conjunction with the kernel to provide an interface for external applications such as mCerebrum to produce and consume data from the system. This is the primary interface on which our high-frequency data streams arrive from mCerebrum.\n\n\nThe \nOpen mHealth APIs\n provide a translation layer between our internal data storage system and their schemas. This allows Cerebral Cortex to pull in data from supported external web services and provide certain MD2K data streams as outputs.\n\n\nA \ndata import and export\n module is designed to translate high-frequency data streams into commonly usable formats for use by health and data science researchers. It will also support inserting data into Cerebral Cortex from these same formats.\n\n\n\n\nBoth the user and machine interfaces are built around a rapidly deployable containerized platform (Docker) to support a more flexible set of deployments across multiple different cloud architectures.\n\n\nAnalytics\n\n\nThe analytics layer contains modules primarily designed around the Apache Spark toolchain to run algorithm on the population-scale data sets that Cerebral Cortex contains.  Many processes parallel what is computed in mCerebrum and extends the analysis to examine data at larger time resolutions (e.g., processing the entire day\u2019s worth of data for better estimate of baseline physiology rather than relying on history for online computation in mCerebrum) for higher accuracy and for population scale analytics. Described are several modules within the system.\n\n\n\n\nStress\n is a cloud implementation of the cStress research and is designed to run on an entire person\u2019s data instead of the real-time implementation on mCerebrum.\n\n\npuffMarker\n the cloud implementation of the puffMarker research where it can also look at an entire person\u2019s dataset.\n\n\nFeature/Marker computation\n contains additional feature and marker computations that support research or models and generally do not fit into specific algorithms.\n\n\nThe \ndata quality\n module is designed to determine the effectiveness (i.e., yield) of collected data streams and provides a classification of potential problems and errors. This module is designed to aid in diagnosing data failures in the mCerebrum platform.\n\n\nA \nbatch processor\n provides a mechanism to read data from HBase and run algorithms on it without worrying about writing specialized distributed processing code.\n\n\nMachine learning\n support multiple libraries include Scikit-learn and Spark\u2019s MLlib. The ultimate goal for machine learning is to interoperate with the Discover Dashboard to provide an interactive interface on which various machine learning techniques can quickly be evaluated and tunes. Models learned on population-scale data can be sent back to a smartphone in the field to improve detection and classification accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nData Storage\n\n\nData storage is currently provided by a combination of the Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and HBase, a distributed bigtable datastore. HBase is responsible for storing the vast majority of the high-frequency time series data streams and provides a queryable interface that integrates well with the analytics layer tools.",

The  Cerebral Cortex API  is designed to work in conjunction with the kernel to provide an interface for external applications such as mCerebrum to produce and consume data from the system. This is the primary interface on which our high-frequency data streams arrive from mCerebrum.  The  Open mHealth APIs  provide a translation layer between our internal data storage system and their schemas. This allows Cerebral Cortex to pull in data from supported external web services and provide certain MD2K data streams as outputs.  A  data import and export  module is designed to translate high-frequency data streams into commonly usable formats for use by health and data science researchers. It will also support inserting data into Cerebral Cortex from these same formats.

Described are several modules within the system.   Stress  is a cloud implementation of the cStress research and is designed to run on an entire person\u2019s data instead of the real-time implementation on mCerebrum.  puffMarker  the cloud implementation of the puffMarker research where it can also look at an entire person\u2019s dataset.  Feature/Marker computation  contains additional feature and marker computations that support research or models and generally do not fit into specific algorithms.  The  data quality  module is designed to determine the effectiveness (i.e., yield) of collected data streams and provides a classification of potential problems and errors. This module is designed to aid in diagnosing data failures in the mCerebrum platform.  A  batch processor  provides a mechanism to read data from HBase and run algorithms on it without worrying about writing specialized distributed processing code.  Machine learning  support multiple libraries include Scikit-learn and Spark\u2019s MLlib. The ultimate goal for machine learning is to interoperate with the Discover Dashboard to provide an interactive interface on which various machine learning techniques can quickly be evaluated and tunes.
